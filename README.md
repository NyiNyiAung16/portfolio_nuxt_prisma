# My Portfolio Website

I built this project for personal and work. If someone wants to see my skills and others, they can easily look my projects and others. When I build this project, I faced a lot of challenges. I faced challenges in hosting because I host Nuxt framework for the first time. And I have a weakness in UI. So Thinking about UI is also a little challenge.


## Features

I have two main features. First one is comment feature. In that feature, everyone can send messages in the specific project. When you want to edit or delete a comment, I checked the user authorization. Second one is admin feature. In the admin feature, admin can see projects and users list. Also admin can create project.

### Other Features

- Light and Dark Mode
- Authencation
